- [x] finish the code
- [ ] compelete the documentation-find a way other than the github readme, because github does not render latex for the mathematics

The secant method is defined by the recurrence relation

As can be seen from the recurrence relation, the secant method requires two initial values, x0 and x1, which should ideally be chosen to lie close to the root.




You can find more about the secant method [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method).
There are some plots, flowchart and animation that are interesting and helpful.
